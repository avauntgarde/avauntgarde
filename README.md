## Hello Hello 🌱

I'm Avaunt, a tech and programming enthusiast!

I'm currently getting my toes in the water in many areas such as programming (Lua, Python, JS) and homelabbing (Proxmox, Navidrome, Jellyfin).

I'm using a ThinkPad T14 Gen1 AMD Pro running Fedora Hyprland.

The best way to reach out to me is on Discord: **@avauntgard**

Soon, I’ll be adding projects from Roblox that I'm working on solo or collaborating on with the studio I work under.
